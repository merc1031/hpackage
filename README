Prereqs:
cabal freeze
pkg/debian/configuration.sh

go to your haskell project, bump your version , copy it into the root directory.
update debian/changelog
run ./mktar.sh

dir should look like
    debian
    myproject-version.tar.gz
    myproject


run get deps, which should, using your cabal.config constraints, get all deps into bundled dependencies

copy dirs to build machine

run debian build pbuilder.

should get cabal and ghc deps

using those should install all sources as add-sources , and install them as deps
then build the project.
