Prereqs:
In your haskell project:

cabal freeze

A file called ```pkg/debian/configuration.sh``` should exist. It will take 2 arguments 1=the directory to create a debian files structure in ($1/usr/bin, $1/etc/whatever), 2=the intermediate directory to this haskell project that is being built.
Additionally it needs to return the unqualified path to the executable that will be used to determine debian deps (ex: usr/bin/program  -- note there is no $1/ or / or ./ at the start).
This script is allows to copy / modify / create files that will be added to the debian files structure.

Any other dependencies should be in externals/

How To Use:

go to your haskell project, bump your version , copy it into the root directory of a hpackage clone (hpackage/myproject). Ideally without a git directory or svn directory or .cabal-sandbox or dist.
update debian/changelog
run ./mktar.sh

dir should look like
    debian/
    config
    README
    get-deps.sh
    mktar.sh
    myproject-version.tar.gz
    myproject-version/
    myproject/


run ```get-deps.sh```, which should, using your cabal.config constraints, get all deps into bundled dependencies


The rest depends on your build environment. The rules file in this project will build using the gotten versions from cabal added as add-source dependencies to force the solver not to fetch them from the web after this point.

Ex:
copy dirs to build machine, that cannot get to cabal

run debian build pbuilder.

should get cabal and ghc deps from the bundled-dependencies folder

using those should install all sources as add-sources , and install them as deps
then build the project.
